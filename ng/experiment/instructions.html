  <h1>Instructions</h1>

  <p>On the following pages, you will enter some demographic information on a form,
    then see a series of sentences, which you will re-type on your keyboard.</p>

  <p>Each of these sentences will be one line, and after you are done typing, you will submit your response by hitting the "enter" or "return" key on your keyboard.</p>

  <p>You cannot edit what you have typed by using arrow keys or by selecting portions of the text with your mouse, as you can with normal text input, but you can use the "backspace" key ("delete" on an Apple keyboard) to go back.</p>
